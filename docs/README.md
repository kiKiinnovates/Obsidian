# Hack All The Things
***
## Isn't this just a nerfed HackTricks?
This repo is my personal repertoire of technology and security-related notes since day one in the field. It is also my attempt to give back to the infosec community. It has all the references, checklists, cheat sheets, and notes I use daily. I forgot to say, I am very forgetful üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So, I am probably the person who uses this the most üëÄ. I hope this repo can help you as much as it does help me. 

I don't think of myself just as a security person ü¶ù. I am a learner. You will find notes on technical writing, scoping, soft skills, software engineering, development, system design, and server administration. In addition, to the good old security notes.

## Online book
